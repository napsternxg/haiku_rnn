abandoned farmhouse:	bird nest in the mail box	also deserted
abandoned farmhouse:	wallpaper peeling back to	my childhood
abandoned farmhouse:	something scratching	inside the furnace
abandoned farmhouse:	the quiet bedroom where i	feared the dark
abandoned farmhouse: a	yellowed grocery list taped	to the counter top
abandoned farmhouse: a	moth flies out of the water	faucet
abandoned farmhouse:	my daughter	snaps pictures of our visit
into old pots and pans	thrown out in the backyard	the musical rain
here & there	in bare treetops	mistletoe
in a shabby motel	all night	treefrogs in rain
cottonmouths	in the swamp ...	a house on stilts
**
family get-together	all the eyes all the feelers	all the hands tearing shrimp
morning in the french quarter	caf au lait &	beignets with sparrows
the river wind blows	into the quarter	& through his saxophone
on the riverfront	a stranger	takes my smile
the breeze	off the mississippi	fills my skirt
behind grillwork	down darkness to sun	in a hidden courtyard
cool the alley	through the grillwork swirls	cat pee smell
in the morning shops	half the doorways	fill with shade
all the mardi gras colors	in the masks	in the houses
on the iron lace balconies	only flowers	sunning
from the suite dusk	fills in the river	& all the tiny lights are slow
**
huge limbs of the live oak	their reaching out	over the young grass
in a pecan grove	wandering spring shadows	cows & blackbirds
parked on the runway	its wings drooped a b-52	the winter sun
the slow day ...	in the empty motel corridor	a stack of dirty dishes
sundown in the empty bar	the player-piano keys	begin
the big waitress departs	the china teapot	shakes
january sun ...	the cotton fields	dotted with leftovers
longest night	his forehead burning	into my hand
what passion	you had, akiko	where can i put	even an inch	of tonight's anguish!
sucking	chocolate squares	oh, it's a lonely beginning	this first night of return	to japan
under this basholess	pre-dawn sky	how rough	the angle of loneliness	along this eastern sea
bent	like a puzzle	in a child's hand,	that back before me	in the pre-dawn dark
is it a walking	umbrella?	immense the black	over that bent-against-the-wind	angle of loneliness
a crane	skipping before me	on this seaside road,	its leg	a karate lift?
i hug	the boy to me	how brave he was to point and say	this is a pencil	this is a cup
on my office couch	i lean back,	back,	this nescafe's	the length of my desire
in this bare	late-afternoon life	i make	my bare dinner	and set out fork and knife
wanting	to embrace	even a sleeve	tonight's	lonely angle
gone from the wood	the bird i knew	by song alone
on lookout rock	one step	to the red hawk
i	a red shaft of light	dances on your moist eyelids:	the searing morning.
ii	frog mountain rises	to arch its back in the clouds:	unforeseen downpour.
iii	three men and three birds	stand still in the forest, all	surprised by rain.
iv	rain like the deluge:	a mudspattered apache	sings in cibecue.
v	the day hides itself	within a grove of aspen.	thunder pursues it.
vi	uprooted clouds:	summer holds the pale mountains,	calls down the clear night.
cajun cabin 	the aroma of hot gumbo	floats on the bayou
gunshot!	the tide of gulls breaks	like a scattering wave
gathering silence	in my mind is	the hardest thing to do
against the wind's chill	i button my sweater	feet dug in sand
the sun slips low	a carnelian red paving	the water with dark light
how many wanderers	have followed the sun	down?
(the girl with the soul	of a gull	never came back)
questions	purl like schools of fish	in dangerous waters
questions	without breath without answers	a broken shell
on the cardboard box	holding the frozen wino:	fragile: do not crush
from the fire escape	the cry of the mourning dove	wintering over
new condominium	its exhaust grate claimed by	a new derelict
wind chill minus five	the piercing whistles	of the starlings
the young mother	stoops to warm the child's mittens	between her gloves
between lace curtains	the white cat's eyes	follow a snowflake
a crow flies down	to land in the new snow	its voice ringing
madison avenue	a row of ginkgoes mulched	with old xmas trees
suet on a string	suspended from a snowy branch	three sparrows make it spin
in the shadow of	office buildings, bagpiper's	amazing grace
last nights fading dream 	on the blue teapot birds drift	beyond the willows
under cloudless skies;	nuclear resister jailed	missiles free to fly
april sun slanting	across the exercise yard	jail-bar shadows
basketball stops	in the exercise yard	convicts shoot the breeze
this heat!	snow-clad mountains framed	by my jail cell window
little ladybug	caught after visiting hours:	doing jail time, too
starting a new month	in snohomish county jail;	same old tea bag
chilly june morning	in a spider web	the jailhouse fly hangs
sixty day jail term	as it grows shorter	my growing beard
a swallowtail	settles	on the prize-winning quilt
summer afternoon	the priest takes a blue pencil	from the blind man
coming up through	a gap in the city bridge. .	a checkerspot butterfly
backfire	a checkerspot in its sound	shifts direction
dog coming out	with the cathedral crowd. .	tail upward
half way home	pole shadows reach across	the widening road
train whistle	two jets wrap the sky	with mist
a block from home	a pair of rain drops find	my haiku notes
snow geese	sarah discovers	the letter v
suddenly	twenty years later	you taste the same
through two marriages	framed behind beethoven	your picture
talking with him	i taste you	in the tea you serve
on your porch	only the breeze	moves between us
in the dark car	the scent of you	and the rainy fields
juice from the apple	runs into my beard	as i wait for you
in the mirror	the only picture	of us together
your perfume	looking up startled	at a stranger
in the cold fireplace	my last letter	burning
still in the taste	of afternoon tea,	my grandmothers brogue
a horse-drawn plow:	sunflowers stand	in the traces
eaves	pulling sound	from the wind
walking alone	the way oak leaves	refuse to fall
a steady rain	the dentists drill	turning to snow
top of the falls	your voice somewhere	in its sound
the worm	far out on this paved lot	more rain
autumn dusk the crooked road home
winter morning	the closet dark with	old shoes
the family gathered	a tear of embalming fluid runs	from my brothers eye
a moth flies	through my breath	in moonlight
bitter wind 	the hand that cups the flame	aglow
the sound of scissors	through quilt stuffing:	chill autumn moon
autumn maple	a gust of yellow scatters	the childs laughter
autumn sky	the wind folds and unfolds	a flock of sparrows
moving into the sun	the pony takes with him	some mountain shadow
paddling slowly	through the reeds	that touch her hair
the old woman	looking into the stars	sky all snowy
against his coat	i brush my lips	the silence of snowflakes
away from eyes	the stairwell holds	us in its arms
that sonofabitch	on the corner has a knife	the rain glistens on it
still	childless:	milkweed
winters end	a bitterness remaining	in the dried apricots
the old garden fence	now keeps the goldenrod	from the goldenrod
thin icicles	on the telephone wire	her distant voice
hoping the shape	of the navel will be good	father cuts the cord
one cricket sound and silence lighting the autumn garden
hot rock by the stream	each of the babys toeprints	evaporating
switching off the light	switching off the shadows
in these dark   waters   drawn up from   my frozen well ...   glittering of spring
standing still   at dusk   listen ... in far   distances   the song of froglings!
i dreamed of   battles   and was slain...   oh savage samurai!   insatiable fleas!
in silent   mid-night   our old scarecrow   topples down...   weird hollow echo
women planting   rice...   ugly every bit   about them...   but their ancient song
wild geese write   a line   flap-flapping   across the sky ...   comical dutch script
dead my old   fine hopes   and dry my dreaming   but still...   iris, blue each spring
in this windy   nest   open your hungry   mouth in vain...   issa, stepchild bird
ballet in the   air ...   twin butterflies   until, twice white   they meet, they mate
on the death   of his child   dew evaporates   and all our world   is dew ... so dear,   so fresh, so fleeting
black cloudbank   broken   scatters in the   night ... now see   moon-lighted mountains!
seek on high   bare trails   sky-reflecting   violets...   mountain-top jewels
for a lovely   bowl   let us arrange these   flowers...   since there is no rice
now that eyes   of hawks   in dusky night   are darkened...   chirping of the quails
my two plum   trees are   so gracious ...   see, they flower   one now, one later
one fallen   flower   returning to the   branch? ... oh no!   a white butterfly
cloudbank   curling low?   ah! the mountain   yoshino ...   cherry cumulus!
fie! this   fickle world!   three days, neglected   cherry-branch ...   and you are bare
hanging the   lantern   on that full white   blooming bough...   exquisite your care!
april's air   stirs in   willow-leaves ...   a butterfly   floats and balances
in the sea-surf   edge   mingling with   bright small shells ..   bush-clover petals
the river   gathering may rains   from cold streamlets   for the sea ...   murmuring mogami
a gate made all   of twigs   with woven grass   for hinges ...   for a lock ... this snail
wind-blown,   rained on ...   bent barley-grass   you make me   narrow path indeed
arise from sleep,   old cat,   and with great yawns   and stretchings ...   amble out for love
white cloud of   mist   above white   cherry-blossoms ...   dawn-shining mountains
hi! my little   hut   is newly-thatched   i see...   blue morning-glories
in the city   fields   contemplating   cherry-trees ...   strangers are like friends
see, see, see!   oh see!   oh what to say?   ah yoshino ...   mountain-all-abloom!
green   shadow-dances ...   see our young   banana-tree   pattering the screen
don't touch my   plumtree!   said my friend   and saying so ...   broke the branch for me
twilight   whippoorwill ...   whistle on,   sweet deepener   of dark loneliness
reciting   scriptures...   strange the   wondrous blue i find   in morning-glories
many solemn   nights   blond moon, we stand   and marvel...   sleeping our noons away
mountain-rose   petals   falling, falling,   falling now ...   waterfall music
amorous cat,   alas   you too must yowl   with your love...   or even worse, without!
the laden wagon   runs   bumbling and creaking   down the road...   three peonies tremble
ah me! i am one   who spends his little   breakfast   morning-glory gazing
my good father   raged   when i snapped   the peony...   precious memory!
by that fallen   house   the pear-tree stands   full-blooming ...   an ancient battle-site
in the open   shop   paperweights on   picture books...   young springtime breeze
dim the grey   cow comes   mooing mooing   and mooing   out of the morning mist
take the round   flat moon   snap this twig   for handle...   what a pretty fan!
seas are wild   tonight...   stretching over   sado island   silent clouds of stars
why so scrawny,   cat?   starving for fat fish   or mice ...   or backyard love?
dewdrop, let me   cleanse   in your brief   sweet waters ...   these dark hands of life
lightning   flash, crash...   waiting in the   bamboo grove   see three dew-drops fall
ashes my burnt   hut ...   but wonderful   the cherry   blooming on my hill
life? butterfly   on a swaying grass   that's all ...   but exquisite!
glorious the   moon...   therefore our thanks   dark clouds   come to rest our necks
what a peony...   demanding to be   measured   by my little fan!
under   cherry-trees   soup, the salad,   fish and all ...   seasoned with petals
now from   cherry-trees ...   millions of maidens   flying   fierce war-lord storm
moon so bright   for love!   come closer, quilt...   enfold   my passionate cold!
too curious   flower   watching us pass,   met death...   our hungry donkey
cloud of   cherry-bloom ...   tolling twilight   bell ... temple   ueno? asakura?
must springtime   fade?   then cry all birds ...   and fishes'   cold pale eyes pour tears
a nursemaid   scarecrow...   frightening the   wind and sun   from playing baby
on her dead son   in what windy land   wanders now   my little dear   dragonfly hunter?
a saddening   world:   flowers whose sweet   blooms must fall...   as we too, alas...
describe   plum-blossoms?   better than my   verses ... white   wordless butterflies
lend me water please?   some fresh young   morning-glory,   careless ... took my well
a young sister   pitiful ... on my   outstretched palm   at dusk dies   the little firefly
you stupid   scarecrow!   under your very   stick-feet   birds are stealing beans!
afternoon   shower...   walking and talking   in the street:   umbrella and raincoat!
in the farther   field   a scarecrow kept me   company ...   walking as i walked
pretty   butterflies...   be careful of   pine-needle points   in this gusty wind!
ah, unrequited   love!   now elevate your chin   and keen   tom-cat, to the moon!
hi! kids   mimicking   cormorants ... you are   more like   real cormorants than   they!
buzzing the bee   trades   peony for peony   with the butterfly
such utter   silence!   even the crickets   singing...   muffled by hot rocks
far across low   mist   intermittently   the lake   lifts a snow-white sail
a white swan   swimming ...   parting with her   unmoved breast   cherry-petaled pond
for a cool   evening   i hired the   old temple porch ...   penny in the dish
quite a hundred   gourds   sprouting from   the fertile soul...   of a single vine
swallow in the   dusk...   spare my little   buzzing friends   among the flowers
old dark sleepy   pool...   quick unexpected   frog   goes plop! watersplash!
my shadowy path   i've swept all day   and now ... oh no!   camellia-shower!
hard the   beggar's bed ...   but sociable   and busy   with insect-talking
come come! come   out!   from bogs old frogs   command the dark   and look ... the stars!
over the   mountain   bright the full white   moon now smiles...   on the flower-thief
starting to   call you:   come watch   these butterflies ...   oh! i'm all alone
good friend   grasshopper   will you play   the caretaker   for my little grave?
a lost child   crying   stumbling over   the dark fields ...   catching fireflies
the snake   departed   but the little eyes   that glared...   dew, shining in the grass
ah! brave dragon-fly   ...   taking for your perch   this swatter   consecrate to death
i raised my   knife to it:   then walked   empty-handed on ...   proud rose of sharon
giddy   grasshopper   take care ... do not   leap and crush   these pearls of dewdrop
darting   dragon-fly ...   pull off its shiny   wings and look...   bright red pepper-pod
reply:   bright red pepper-pod ...   it needs but shiny   wings and look...   darting dragon-fly!
tiny sentences   brushing soft on   my shutters...   bush-clover voices
mirror-pond of   stars ...   suddenly a summer   shower   dimples the water
sadness at   twilight...   villain! i have   let my hand   cut that peony
in dim dusk and   scent   a witness   now half hidden...   evenfall orchid
now be a good   boy   take good care of   our house ...   cricket my child
wake! the sky   is light!   let us to the road   again...   companion butterfly!
stillness ...   then the bat   flying among   the willows   black against green sky
now my   loneliness   following   the fireworks...   look! a falling star!
stupid hot   melons...   rolling   like fat idiots   out from leafy shade!
for   morning-glories   i can foresee grave   danger...   single-stick practice
can't it get   away   from the sticky   pine-branches ...   cicada singing?
silent the old   town...   the scent of flowers   floating...   and evening bell
vendor of   bright fans   carrying his pack   of breeze...   suffocating heat!
voices of two   bells   that speak from   twilight temples...   ah! cool dialogue
deep in dark   forest   a woodcutter's   dull axe talking...   and a woodcutter
camellia-petal   fell in silent dawn ...   spilling   a water-jewel
in the twilight   rain   these brilliant-hued   hibiscus ...   a lovely sunset
friend, that   open mouth   reveals your   whole interior...   silly hollow frog!
butterfly   asleep   folded soft on   temple bell...   then bronze gong rang!
good evening breeze!   crooked and   meandering   your homeward journey
see the morning   breeze   ruffling his so   silky hair...   cool caterpillar
oh lucky   beggar!...   bright heaven   and cool earth   your summer outfit
the turnip   farmer rose   and with a fresh-   pulled turnip...   pointed to my road
flower in the   stream   thus too my lovely life   must end, another   flower...   to fall and float away
i am going out   ...   be good and play   together   my cricket children
not a voice or   stir ...   darkness lies on   fields and streets   sad: the moon has set
lady butterfly   perfumes her wings   by floating   over the orchid
if strangers   threaten   turn into fat   green bullfrogs...   pond-cooling melons
yellow evening   sun ...   long shadow   of the scarecrow   reaches to the road
a camellia   dropped down into   still waters   of a deep dark well
for the emperor   himself he will not   lift his hat ...   a stiff-backed scarecrow
in the holy   dusk   nightingales begin   their psalm...   good! the dinner-gong!
live in simple   faith ...   just as this   trusting cherry   flowers, fades, and falls
night is bright   with stars   ... silly woman,   whimpering:   shall i light the lamp?
black desolate   moor...   i bow before   the buddha   lighted in thunder
dirty   bath-water   where can i pour   you? ... insects   singing in the grass
wee bitter   cricket   crying all this   sunny day ...   or is he laughing?
a short summer   night...   but in this solemn   darkness   one peony bloomed
long the summer   day ...   patterns on   the ocean sand...   our idle footprints
angry i strode   home...   but stooping in   my garden   calm old willow-tree
oh do not swat   them ...   unhappy flies   forever   wringing their thin hands
see ... the   heavy leaf   on the silent   windless day ...   falls of its own will
rash tom-cat   lover...   careless even   of that rice   stuck in your whiskers
moon so bright   for love!   oh, hear the farmer   by that light...   flailing his lovely rice!
now the   swinging bridge   is quieted   with creepers...   like our tendrilled life
dancing in my   silks   money tossed itself   away...   pretty, this paper dress!
the sea   darkening...   oh voices of the   wild ducks   crying, whirling, white
white moth,   flutter off:   fly back into   my breast now   quickly, my own soul!
nine times   arising   to see the moon...   whose solemn pace   marks only midnight yet
watching, i   wonder   what poet could put   down his quill...   a pluperfect moon!
do your worst,   old frost   you can no longer   wound me ...   last chrysanthemum i
pebbles shining   clear,   and clear   six silent fishes...   deep autumn water
a bright autumn   moon...   in the shadow of   each grass   an insect chirping
you turn and   suddenly   there in purpling   autumn sky ...   white fujiami
here, where a   thousand   captains swore grand   conquest ... tall   grass their monument
yellow autumn   moon...   unimpressed   the scarecrow stands   simply looking bored
white chrysanthemum   ...   before that   perfect flower   scissors hesitate
cruel autumn   wind   cutting to the   very bones...   of my poor scarecrow
now in late   autumn   look, on my old   rubbish-heap ...   blue morning-glory
a single   cricket   chirps, chirps, chirps,   and is still ... my   candle sinks and dies
fireworks ended   and spectators   gone away...   ahd how vast and dark!
two ancient   pine-trees ...   a pair of gnarled   and sturdy hands   with ten green fingers
i must turn   over...   beware of local   earthquakes   bedfellow cricket!
oh! i ate them   all   and oh! what a   stomach-ache...   green stolen apples
now in sad   autumn   as i take my   darkening path ...   a solitary bird
at our last   parting   bending between   boat and shore...   that weeping willow
at furue in   rain   gray water and   gray sand...   picture without lines
oh sorry tom-cat   bigger blacker   knights of love   have knocked you out!
the old   fisherman   unalterably   intent...   cold evening rain
while i turned   my head   that traveler   i'd just passed ...   melted into mist
visiting the   graves ...   trotting on to show   the way ...   old family dog
will we meet   again   here at your   flowering grave...   two white butterflies?
so enviable...   maple-leaves   most glorious   contemplating death
shocking ...   the red of   lacquered fingernails   against   a white chrysanthemum
dry cheerful   cricket   chirping, keeps   the autumn gay ...   contemptuous of frost
deepen, drop,   and die   many-hued   chrysanthemums...   one black earth for all
before boiled   chestnuts   cross-legged lad   is squatting...   carved wooden buddha
defeated in the   fray   by bigger battlers   for love...   tom-cat seeks a mouse
asking their road...   seven yellow   bamboo hats   all turned together
torches! come   and see   the burglar i have   captured...   oh! my eldest son!
autumn   mosquitoes   buzz me, bite me ...   see, i am   long prepared for death
nice: wild   persimmons...   and notice how   the mother   eats the bitter parts
gray marsh,   black cloud   flapping away   in autumn rain   last old slow heron
first white   snow of fall   just enough to bend   the leaves   of faded daffodils
what a gorgeous   one   that fat sleek huge   old chestnut   i could not get at ...
none broke the   silence...   nor visitor   nor host ... nor   white chrysanthemum
if you were   silent   flight of herons   on dark sky ...   oh! autumn snowflakes!
chilling autumn   rain...   the moon, too bright   for showers,   slips from their fingers
rainy-month,   dripping   on and on   as i lie abed...   ah, old man's memories!
november   sunrise...   uncertain, the cold   storks stand ...   bare sticks in water
from dark windy   hills   voices driving   weary horses ...   shouting of the storm
slanting lines   of rain...   on the dusty   samisen   a mouse is trotting
oh former   renter   i know it all, all ...   down to   the very cold you felt
gray moor,   unmarred   by any path ...   a single branch ...   a bird ... november
lonely umbrella   passing the house   at twilight...   first snow falling soft
carven gods   long gone...   dead leaves alone   foregather   on the temple porch
five or six of   us   remain, huddled   together...   bent old willow-trees
plume of pampas   grass   trembling   in every wind...   hush, my lonely heart
tea-water,   tired   waiting while we   watched the snow...   froze itself a hat
cold first   winter rain...   poor monkey,   you too could use   a little woven cape
winter rain   deepens   lichened letters   on the grave...   and my old sadness
cold winter   shower ..   see all the people   running   across seta bridge!
old weary   willows...   i thought how long   the road would be   when you went away
no oil to read   by ...   i am off to bed   but ah!...   my moonlit pillow
descending   seaward   far-off mountain   waterfall...   winter nights are still
all heaven and   earth   flowered white   obliterate...   snow ... unceasing snow
considerate   dogs ...   stepping off   into the snow   as i walk the path
but when i   halted   on the windy street   at twilight...   snow struck against me
call him back!   ah no,   he's blown from sight   already...   fish-peddler in the snow
crossing it alone   in cold moonlight...   the brittle bridge   echoes my footsteps
such a little   child   to send to be   a priestling   icy poverty
windy winter   rain...   my silly big   umbrella   tries walking backward
buddha on the   hill...   from your holy   nose indeed   hangs an icicle
this snowy   morning   that black crow   i hate so much...   but he's beautiful!
look at the   candle!   what a hungry wind   it is...   hunting in the snow!
if there were   fragrance   these heavy snow-   flakes settling...   lilies on the rocks
ah! i intended   never never   to grow old ...   listen: new year's bell!
snow-swallowed   valley:   only the   winding river...   black fluent brush-stroke
roaring winter   storm   rushing to its   utter end ...   ever-sounding sea
eleven brave   knights   canter through the   whirling snow...   not one bends his neck
going   snow-viewing   one by one the   walkers vanish...   whitely falling veils
"yes, come   in!" i cried...   but at the windy   snow-hung gate   knocking still went on
see: surviving   suns   visit the ancestral   grave ...   bearded, with bent canes
the orphan   speaks:   the year-end party...   i am even envious   of scolded children
i gave the   greetings   of the bright   new year ... as though   i held a plum-branch
on jolly new   year's day   my last year's bills   drop in   to pay their compliments
death-song:   leaf alone, fluttering   alas, leaf alone,   fluttering ...   floating down the wind
death-song:   i have known lovers...   cherry-bloom ...   the nightingale ...   i will sleep content
death-song:   fever-felled half-way,   my dreams arose   to march again...   into a hollow land
death-song:   three loveliest things:   moonlight ... cherry-   bloom ... now i go   seeking silent snow
